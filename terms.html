    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Effective immediately</p>

    <p>By accessing or purchasing from <strong>www.dubis.net</strong> ("the Site"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, please don't use the Site — no hard feelings.</p>

    <h2>1. About DUBIS</h2>
    <p>DUBIS is an independent clothing brand that sells custom print-on-demand apparel. Products are manufactured and fulfilled by Printful Inc. on our behalf.</p>

    <h2>2. Products & Orders</h2>
    <p>All products are made to order. Sizes, colours, and designs shown on the Site are as accurate as we can make them, but slight variations may occur in the print process.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order at our sole discretion, including in cases of suspected fraud, pricing errors, or availability issues. If we cancel your order after payment, you will receive a full refund.</p>

    <h2>3. Pricing & Payment</h2>
    <p>All prices are displayed in US Dollars (USD). Payment is processed securely via PayPal. We do not store your payment card details — that's PayPal's job, and they're good at it.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change prices at any time. The price shown at checkout is the price you pay.</p>

    <h2>4. Shipping & Delivery</h2>
    <p>Orders are fulfilled within 2–7 business days and then shipped. Shipping times vary by destination:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>United States:</strong> 3–7 business days after dispatch</li>
        <li><strong>International:</strong> 10–20 business days after dispatch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are estimates, not guarantees. We're not responsible for delays caused by customs, carriers, or forces of nature. Once your package ships, you'll get a tracking link by email.</p>

    <h2>5. Returns & Refunds</h2>
    <p>Because every item is made specifically for you, we don't accept returns for buyer's remorse or size issues. We strongly encourage you to consult the size guide before ordering.</p>
    <p>We will replace or refund items that arrive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Damaged or defective</li>
        <li>Significantly different from what was ordered</li>
        <li>Lost in transit (after 30 days with no movement)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To request a replacement or refund, email <a href="mailto:dubis.brand@gmail.com">dubis.brand@gmail.com</a> within 30 days of your delivery date. Include your order number and a photo of the issue. Full details: <a href="/returns">Return & Refund Policy →</a></p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content on the Site — text, images, logos, graphics — is owned by or licensed to DUBIS. You may not reproduce, redistribute, or create derivative works without our written permission.</p>
    <p>By placing an order, you confirm that any custom phrase or content you submit does not infringe third-party rights, and you grant DUBIS a licence to use it to fulfil your order.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, DUBIS shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Site or purchase of our products. Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid for the relevant order.</p>

    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy matters. We collect only what we need to fulfil your order. See our <a href="/#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be noted by updating the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the Site after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these Terms? Email us at <a href="mailto:dubis.brand@gmail.com">dubis.brand@gmail.com</a>. We're real people. We'll reply.</p>
